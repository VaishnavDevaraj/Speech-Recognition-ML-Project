This is a simple Speech Recognition project. This recognizes the following spoken commands and converts them into text:
1. Hello
2. How are you?
3. Goodbye
The goodbye command is used to exit.
You can always modify the code and provide more personalised commands like "open google.com", etc. but for that you will need to add webbrowser module and all appropriate code required
***Note: This is just an example of what Speech Recognition module in  python is capable of!
